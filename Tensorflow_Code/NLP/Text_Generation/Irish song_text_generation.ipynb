Basically, instead of getting the index with max probability, you will get the top three indices and choose one at random. See if the output text makes more sense with this approach. This is not the most time efficient solution because it is always sorting the entire array even if you only need the top three. Feel free to improve it and of course, you can also develop your own method of picking the next word."
